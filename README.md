## About the Titanic 🌊

The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The disaster resulted in the loss of numerous lives and remains one of the most famous maritime tragedies in history.

## Repository Structure 📁

- **csv file folder**: Contains the `train.csv` file 🗃️, which serves as the dataset for training the predictive model.
- **jupyter notebook folder**: Includes a Jupyter notebook 📓 where the model is trained using a Random Forest Regressor, along with various feature engineering techniques and pipelines.
- **streamlit python file folder**: Contains the `pipe_data.pkl` file 🗄️ and `data.py` file 🐍 necessary for model deployment using Streamlit.

## How to Use 🚀

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. In the "streamlit python" folder, save both files to a local folder on your machine.
2. Run `data.py` in your Python IDE or editor.
3. In the terminal of your IDE, execute the command `streamlit run data.py`.
4. This will start the Streamlit application, allowing you to interact with the Titanic Survival Prediction Model.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebook in the "jupyter notebook" folder to gain insights into the model's training process and feature engineering techniques.

Please note that the `train.csv` file in the "csv file folder" serves as the dataset for training the model, and the `pipe_data.pkl` file is necessary for the Streamlit application's functionality.
